# Source Citations Improvements

## Overview
The `SourceCitations` component has been redesigned to provide a more OpenAI-like experience for displaying sources in the RAG system. The improvements focus on better visual hierarchy, improved accessibility, and proper YouTube video linking.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Visual Design
- **OpenAI-inspired layout**: Clean, compact design with proper spacing and typography
- **Numbered sources**: Each source is numbered (1, 2, 3, etc.) similar to OpenAI's approach
- **Improved color scheme**: Subtle borders and hover effects for better user experience
- **Type-specific colors**: Different colors for different source types (YouTube = red, documents = blue, etc.)

### 2. Enhanced Source Information
- **Source type badges**: Clear visual indicators for video, document, manual, and article sources
- **Relevance scoring**: Shows match percentage when available
- **Channel information**: For YouTube videos, displays channel name and publish year
- **Proper truncation**: Long titles are truncated with ellipsis and show full title on hover

### 3. Better YouTube Integration
- **URL formatting**: Ensures proper YouTube URLs are generated
- **Video ID extraction**: Handles various YouTube URL formats (youtube.com, youtu.be, embed)
- **Direct linking**: Opens YouTube videos in new tab with proper attribution

### 4. Improved Accessibility
- **Hover states**: Subtle hover effects for better user feedback
- **Title attributes**: Full titles and channel names available on hover
- **Keyboard navigation**: Links are properly focusable and accessible
- **Screen reader friendly**: Proper semantic markup and ARIA labels

### 5. Integration Improvements
- **MessageRenderer integration**: Sources are now properly displayed in the chat interface
- **Streaming support**: Works with streaming responses and shows sources after completion
- **Error handling**: Graceful handling of missing or malformed source data

## Usage

The component is automatically used in the chat interface when the RAG system returns sources. No additional configuration is required.

```typescript
interface SourceCitation {
  url: string
  title: string
  type: 'youtube' | 'article' | 'document' | 'manual'
  channelTitle?: string
  publishDate?: string
  relevanceScore?: number
}
```

## Features

- **Responsive design**: Works well on mobile and desktop
- **Performance optimized**: Efficient rendering with proper React patterns
- **Consistent styling**: Matches the overall application design system
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new source types or modify existing ones

## Next Steps

1. Add timestamp support for YouTube videos to link to specific moments
2. Implement preview thumbnails for video sources
3. Add support for PDF page numbers in document sources
4. Consider adding source preview on hover
